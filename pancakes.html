        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The basic pancake is made from a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk and baking powder for leavening. You can use different types of flour if you want to experiment with whole wheat or buckwheat. And you can also add fruit to the mixture. The batter can be made from scratch in about the same time it takes to make toast. The most time-consuming part of making pancakes, of course, is cooking them. But that time is so short you should consider these an everyday convenience food, not a special-occasion feast. Cook this recipe a few times and it may become part of your weekly routine.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>       
        </ol>
