        <h1>Chicken Alfredo</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Alfredo is a creamy, dreamy pan sauce made from butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. There are a few additions and adaptations that exist. Unlike béchamel — another classic sauce — Alfredo is best made and eaten straight away. You can use Alfredo for coating broccoli or, most famously, fettuccine. Here, we’re partnering it with pasta and golden crispy chicken breast for a dinner that can make even the most regular Thursday night feel special. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ lb chicken breast (680 g), cubed</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>16 oz penne pasta (455 g), cooked</li>
